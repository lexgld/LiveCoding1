# Min Max Difference

In this problem you will be given an array/list of integers. You need to find the largest value and the smallest value in the array. Finally you need to return the difference (largest value - smallest value) of the two values. Example:

the_array = [15, 22, 84, 14, 88, 23]

the_highest_value = 88

the_smallest_number = 14

the_difference = 74
